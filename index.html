  <p>Below is a list of some of the most expensive laptops ever seen on the market. While some of these are the latest model available today, others are over the top models with price tags that have not yet been topped. Though most of us are happy with a laptop that can hold a ton of emails and a huge iTunes library, these laptops certainly add some glitz and glamour to the portable computer we have come to rely on.</p>

      <p>This flashy number has a black and gray racing check pattern with the small yellow Ferrari insignia stamped in the center. To really give it the sleek feel of it’s namesake, the body is done in jet black with glossy gray accents and the casing is constructed with an ultra-light carbon fiber chassis. To add to the Ferrari feel, there is a bright blacklit power button that looks just like a car ignition. Heads will certainly turn when you sit down in Starbucks with this one.</p>

      <p>This laptop has been customized by Computer Choppers, a company that will personalize any of your high tech gadgets, from laptops to iPads to smart phones and even game controllers. Though they specialize in Apple products, they say they will  provide the service on basically any brand of computer or electronic item. In this particular case they have taken a MacBook Pro and covered it in 24 karat gold. They finished it off with the official Apple logo which features multi-colored diamonds. Needless to say, these are very limited in number. They also offer the same version in the MacBook Air.</p>
